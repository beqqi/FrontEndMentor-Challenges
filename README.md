## My process
I started with structuring the HTML. I used absolute positioning layout to position it. I used the colors as given on the Figma file to create consistency and this is the final look. It could be better, but this is what I could do for now as a beginner but more tricks to come as I get more comfotable with flex and grid to make the page more responsive.

### Built with
This is done by using HTML5 and CSS3


### What I learned
I was greatful that I was provided with the design files as I have been relieved from a lot of work. However, I have been trying to get a grasp on the layouts that are suitable to make the page more responsive, which I was not able to use for this challenge.



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class = "container">
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr_code"/>
    <div>

     <p id="top"> Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
    
      <p id="bottom"> Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>
    </div>
```
```css
.container{
    height: 450px;
    width: 210px;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 5%;
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    top: 25%    
   
}
```
