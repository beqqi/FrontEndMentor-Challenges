## My process
(edit)I have heed the comments of my colleagues and started with the position and that almost improves everything, then I have went to polish the colors and fonts and margings in accordance with the design file.


### Built with
This is done by using HTML5 and CSS3


### What I learned
I was greatful that I was provided with the design files as I have been relieved from a lot of work. However, I have been trying to get a grasp on the layouts that are suitable to make the page more responsive, which I was not able to use for this challenge.



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class = "container">
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr_code"/>
    <div>

     <p id="top"> Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
    
      <p id="bottom"> Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>
    </div>
```
```css
.container{
    height: 450px;
    width: 210px;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 5%;
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    top: 25%    
   
}
```


### Continued development
This challenge has alerted me that I should get a solid grasp on CSS layout and sharpening my understand on those is my goal until I get comfortable with different types of layout especially flex and grid. 
(edit)
I have improved my solution based on the helpful comments I have recieved from the community. This time, it seems a lot closer to the design, however I still could not replicate the font as same as the design, although I have used the same type of fonts and size, etc..
